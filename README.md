# ConsoleSnake
 
Just a little project to help me learn.

The project still needs some cleaning up and I'm not entirely done making the library platform independant (ie: for use with Console, WPF, Unity, etc.). There are still some rough edges, but that's what I'm trying to learn here. I'm trying to make it work regardless of the platform that's using the library file, if that makes sense.
